    <h1><b>I don't like reading books.</b></h1>
    <p>As crazy as this may seem, I don't like to read books.<br/>

I used to enjoy reading books of purely words, but after having
my parents constantly force me to read books, I've only learned
to start disliking reading books. <i>However</i>, I still enjoy
reading graphic novels made by Japanese or Korean authors.<br/>

The most recent graphic novel that I had read would be <i>The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity</i> by Saka Mikami, 
is a coming of age romance story between two high schoolers from neighbouring schools. A boy named Rintaro Tsumugi, 
and a girl named Kaoruko Waguri.<br/>

One of their schools is an all girls-school, with the other being an all-boys school, leading to a huge rivalry 
and hatred between staff and students. However, it is through his family's cake shop that Rintaro meets Kaoruko 
and they become great friends. After working together to slowly get rid of the stigma between the schools, they 
bring their groups together and become a great friends with one another.<br/>

Rintaro also has a troubled past with isolation and bullying because of his scary face. He lacked friends and always 
wanted to reach out to people, but his fear of hurting others caused him to hold himself back as well. His mother, 
who always tried to encourage him, tried her best to support him in any decisions he would make to change his image 
for the better, and he thankfully was able to make friends once he got to high school. However, he continues to lack 
confidence in himself, which is also another aspect to the coming-of-age genre of the story. He learns through his 
new experiences and great friends that he is a good person and deserves to enjoy the good things in his life.<br/>

I think that the story really resonated with me because I personally also lack confidence in myself and had many 
moments in my life where I would hold myself back from taking a chance with new opportunities. Thankfully, I have 
also found a great group of friends who I greatly resonate with and have helped me to improve my social skills. 
And that is the book that I've recently read.</p>
