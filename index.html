    <h1><b>I don't like reading books.</b></h1>
    <p>As crazy as this may seem, I don't like to read books.<br/>
I used to enjoy reading books of purely words, but after having<br/>
my parents constantly force me to read books, I've only learned<br/>
to start disliking reading books. <i>However</i>, I still enjoy<br/>
reading graphic novels made by Japanese or Korean authors.</p>
